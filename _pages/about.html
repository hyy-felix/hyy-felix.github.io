      There is no moment more exhilarating to me than watching a mechanical system I designed come to life. Throughout my past design experiences, I’ve remained passionate about building <strong>robotic vehicles</strong>, <strong>drones</strong>, <strong>quadrupedal robots</strong>, and <strong>humanoid systems</strong>. <strong>Mechanical design</strong> provides the “skeleton,” while <strong>control systems</strong> breathe “life” into the structure — and I am deeply driven to keep exploring their <strong>intersection</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am currently pursuing a <strong>Master’s degree</strong> in <strong>Control of Robotics and Autonomous Systems</strong> at the <strong>University of California, Berkeley</strong>. My focus lies in <strong>MPC control development</strong>, <strong>multimodal mobility platforms</strong>, and the integration of <strong>embedded systems</strong> with <strong>mechanical design</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the future, I hope to work alongside <strong>world-class engineering teams</strong> in industry, contribute to the development of more <strong>challenging products</strong>, and further strengthen my skills in <strong>hardware-software co-design</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every step of my journey has been shaped by the support and inspiration of friends and mentors — each of whom has been a source of growth and motivation. As I move forward, I remain committed to the advancement of <strong>integrated autonomous systems</strong> and look forward to collaborating with <strong>like-minded individuals</strong> to push the boundaries of <strong>intelligence</strong>, <strong>reliability</strong>, and <strong>real-world application</strong> in robotic systems.
