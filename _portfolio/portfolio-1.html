    <p>
      It is designed to operate in hazardous, confined, or otherwise inaccessible environments. The use of simple 3D-printed components allows for easy field assembly and repair, making it a versatile solution for applications ranging from search-and-rescue, last-mile delivery, surveying civil structures, and military demining.
